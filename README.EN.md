## About
*Count the clouds* was born as a project for the Javascript Basics course at Start2Impact University.<br>
The goal of the project was to develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase and decrease the value of a counter. The application had to be developed using only pure JavaScript, without the use of any frameworks.
I chose to transform the simple counter into a small celestial observatory, where each click is like capturing a passing cloud.

## Instructions
How to count the clouds:
1. **Count a cloud** ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ûï
   - When you see a cloud pass by, press the "+" button to count it.
   - Watch the counter rise and keep track of the sky!
2. **Correct the count** ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ûñ
   - If you counted by mistake, use the "-" button to correct.
   - The counter will decrease, allowing you to maintain an accurate count.
3. **Restart the observation** üîÑ
   - The "Reset" button is your new beginning!
   - Press it to:
     - Reset the counter, as at the start of a new observation session.
     - Change the background color.
